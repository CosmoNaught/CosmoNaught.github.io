This study analyzed the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 variants, namely Wildtype, Alpha, Delta, and Omicron, in England, investigating their transmissibility and severity. Using a mathematical model paired with Bayesian inference, the research assessed the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), therapies, and vaccination on the virus's transmission and effects. Results demonstrated that each subsequent variant was more transmissible, with Omicron being the most so. However, Alpha had the highest fatality rate. Findings emphasized the need for continued surveillance and long-term strategies to manage future variants.
