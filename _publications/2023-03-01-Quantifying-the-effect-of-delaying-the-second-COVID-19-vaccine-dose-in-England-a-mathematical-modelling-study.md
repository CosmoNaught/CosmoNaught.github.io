This research evaluated the consequences of England's decision to extend the interval between COVID-19 vaccine doses from 3 to 12 weeks. Utilizing a model of virus transmission and calibrating it to actual data, the study compared potential outcomes had England maintained the initial 3-week gap. Results indicated that the prolonged 12-week interval led to fewer hospitalizations and deaths, providing more individuals with at least partial vaccine-induced protection in the midst of a growing epidemic. The decision, influenced by early data and limited vaccine supply, proved beneficial in reducing COVID-19's overall burden.
