Parkinson's UK
======

I serve [Parkinson's UK](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/) as a Lay Grant Reviewer, where I am entrusted with the responsibility of assessing and advising on research grants. My affiliation with Parkinson's UK isn't just professional; it's deeply personal. With close family members navigating the challenges of Parkinson's disease, I've witnessed first-hand the toll it takes and the urgent need for research, resources, and support. By melding my academic expertise with my commitment to public outreach, I aim to play a part in the fight against this disease and support families like mine who are impacted by it.



Shout 85258
======

As a trained Crisis Volunteer with [Shout 85258](https://giveusashout.org/), I work on the frontlines, providing immediate support to individuals in times of crisis. Being part of this dedicated team requires resilience, empathy, and a steadfast commitment to be there for those grappling with intense emotional distress. Mental health has always been a cause close to my heart. In a world rife with challenges, it's vital that we have institutions like Shout 85258 providing a lifeline to those in need. My association with them is my way of advocating for mental health and ensuring that everyone has a listening ear in their time of need.
