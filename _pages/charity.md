Charity work, for me, is more than just volunteering time or resources; it's a commitment to create meaningful change and offer support where it's most needed. Over the years, I have been fortunate enough to align my professional skills and personal passions with organizations that are making a genuine difference in the lives of individuals. Whether it's advancing critical research for debilitating diseases or offering a hand to hold during rough times, my affiliations with various charities are a testament to my belief in the power of collective efforts. Here are some of the organizations I'm deeply proud to be affiliated with:

# Parkinson's UK
------

I serve [Parkinson's UK](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/) as a Lay Grant Reviewer, where I am entrusted with the responsibility of assessing and advising on research grants. My affiliation with Parkinson's UK isn't just professional; it's deeply personal. With close family members navigating the challenges of Parkinson's disease, I've witnessed first-hand the toll it takes and the urgent need for research, resources, and support. By melding my academic expertise with my commitment to public outreach, I aim to play a part in the fight against this disease and support families like mine who are impacted by it.

# Shout 85258
------

As a trained Crisis Volunteer with [Shout 85258](https://giveusashout.org/), I work on the frontlines, providing immediate support to individuals in times of crisis. Being part of this dedicated team requires resilience, empathy, and a steadfast commitment to be there for those grappling with intense emotional distress. Mental health has always been a cause close to my heart. In a world rife with challenges, it's vital that we have institutions like Shout 85258 providing a lifeline to those in need. My association with them is my way of advocating for mental health and ensuring that everyone has a listening ear in their time of need.

# Red Bag Co
------

I've had the honor of collaborating with [Red Bag Co](https://redbagco.bigcartel.com/) as a dedicated volunteer, taking part in the essential work of preparing and distributing food and healthcare necessities to those without shelter. This bond with Red Bag Co is not solely about charity; it resonates with a profound sense of community and social responsibility. My involvement went beyond mere volunteerism when I played a pivotal role in brokering an invaluable partnership between Greggs and Red Bag Co. This ensured that unsold produce from Greggs at the end of each Sunday was not wasted but instead, freely distributed to those who needed it most. My personal investment, both in time and finances, is a testament to my belief in the charity's mission. As I reflect on its growth, I feel an immense sense of pride and gratification for the lives touched and the community uplifted.
