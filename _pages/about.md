------

A dedicated researcher, analyst and academic with a specialization in machine learning and complex system modelling. I currently focus on engineering neural network emulators tailored for multidimensional epidemiological analyses, particularly for use in malaria. My academic journey has brought me to prestigious institutions like Imperial College London and the German Centre for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI). Notably, my work has been recognized with publications in esteemed journals like [The Lancet](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(22)00337-1) and [Nature](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-39661-5), as well as prestigious international conferences, further accentuating my commitment to research excellence. At the core, I love finding how machine learning and computational mathematics can help solve real-world problems in fields like medicine, public health abd beyond.

While machine learning engineering remains my primary focus, I've also been intrigued by quantum mechanical modelling, as a lasting testament to my enduring passion for the concrete and abstract in mathematics fostered early during my academic career. I try to explore these broader areas whenever time allows. I am deeply committed to ethically responsible AI development, ensuring that our solutions stand up to the highest standards of integrity and applicability across influential sectors. I'm fortunate to speak multiple languages - English, Spanish, German, and French. These skills have often helped me connect across cultures and collaborate on global platforms.

When I'm not engrossed in my work, I channel my creativity into the world of 80s retro-synthwave music and the development of 90s-inspired video games. Imagine the charm of Dwarf Fortress and the wonders of the classic Baldur's Gate series. On top of that, I'm penning a fantasy book series, exploring realms and characters of my own design. For a more analog break, if London's weather agrees, I love taking my bike out for a spin. It's my way of connecting with the world outside.

# Consulting Services
------

At Imperial College London, I lead innovative machine learning initiatives and, as a Research Scientist at the German Centre for Artificial Intelligence, applied sophisticated algorithms to tackle challenges from malaria modeling to tumor prediction to societal issues such as gun-violence dispersion. Recognised in top journals and having played a crucial role during the COVID-19 crisis, I blend expertise in Bayesian Inferencing, Neural Network emulators, and more for precision in large-scale analyses. If you're seeking expertise in machine learning, epidemiological analysis, or wider computational mathematical realms, I offer consulting services. Let's strategise, solve problems, and guide impactful, honest and meaningful research together.
