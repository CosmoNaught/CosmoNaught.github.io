------

A dedicated researcher, analyst and academic with a specialization in machine learning and complex system modelling. I currently focus on engineering neural network emulators tailored for multidimensional intricate epidemiological analyses, particularly in the realm of malaria. My academic journey has brought me to prestigious institutions like Imperial College London and the German Centre for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI). Notably, my work has been recognized with publications in esteemed journals like [The Lancet](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(22)00337-1) and [Nature](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-39661-5), further accentuating my commitment to research excellence. I’ve championed the intersection of machine learning with deep-rooted problems in epidemiology, medicine and public health.

I've also delved into quantum mechanical modelling, as a lasting testament to my enduring passion for philosophical mathematics fostered early during my academic career. I am obsessed by the intricacies between the tangible and the abstract, thus I ensure that I keep my eye on broader fields, as often as I can spare it.

I am deeply committed to ethically responsible AI development, ensuring that our solutions stand up to the highest standards of integrity and applicability in critical sectors. I'm fortunate to speak multiple languages - English, Spanish, German, and French. These skills have often helped me connect across cultures and collaborate on global platforms.

When I'm not engrossed in my work, I channel my creativity into the world of 80s retro-synthwave music and the development of 90s-inspired video games. Imagine the charm of Dwarf Fortress, the adventure of Oregon Trail, and the depth of the classic Baldur's Gate series. On top of that, I'm penning a fantasy book series, exploring realms and characters of my own design. And when I need a break from these worlds, and London weather permitting, there's nothing like hopping on my bike—a perfect way to clear my mind and enjoy the outdoors.

# Consulting Services
------

At Imperial College London, I led innovative machine learning initiatives and, as a Research Scientist at the German Centre for Artificial Intelligence, applied sophisticated algorithms to tackle challenges from malaria modeling to tumor prediction to societal issues such as gun-violence dispersion. Recognised in top journals and having played a crucial role during the COVID-19 crisis, I blend expertise in Bayesian Inferencing, Neural Network emulators, and more for precision in large-scale analyses. If you're seeking expertise in machine learning, epidemiological analysis, or wider computational mathematical realms, I offer consulting services. Let's strategise, solve problems, and guide impactful, honest and meaningful research together.
