About me
======
A dedicated researcher, analyst and academic with a specialization in machine learning and complex system modelling, I currently focus on engineering neural network emulators tailored for multidimensional, intricate epidemiological analyses, particularly in the realm of malaria. My academic journey has brought me to prestigious institutions like Imperial College London and the German Centre for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI), where I’ve championed the intersection of machine learning with deep-rooted problems in epidemiology and public health.

My expertise isn't limited to the biological realm; I've also delved into quantum mechanical modelling, as a lasting testament to my enduring passion for philosophical mathematics fostered early during my academic career. I am obsessed by the intricacies between the tangible and the abstract, thus I ensure that I keep my eye on broader fields, as often as I can spare it.

Beyond the rigours of academia and research, I am deeply committed to ethically responsible AI development, ensuring that our solutions stand up to the highest standards of integrity and applicability in critical sectors. My multilingual prowess, encompassing English, Spanish, German, and French, has often been my bridge in multicultural engagements, fostering collaborations on global platforms.

"When I'm not engrossed in my work, I channel my creativity into the world of 80s retro-synthwave music and the development of 90s-inspired video games. Imagine the charm of Dwarf Fortress, the adventure of Oregon Trail, and the depth of the classic Baldur's Gate series. On top of that, I'm penning a fantasy book series, exploring realms and characters of my own design. And when I need a break from these worlds, and London weather permitting, there's nothing like hopping on my bike—a perfect way to clear my mind and enjoy the outdoors.
