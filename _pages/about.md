I am a dedicated researcher with a deep specialization in machine learning and complex system modelling. Presently, my work revolves around engineering neural network emulators for multidimensional epidemiological analyses, especially in the realm of malaria. I've had the privilege to contribute at renowned institutions such as Imperial College London and the German Centre for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI). My research contributions have been acknowledged with publications in leading journals like  [The Lancet](https://doi.org/10.1016/S2468-2667(22)00337-1) and [Nature](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-39661-5) and presentations at major international conferences. My work is driven by a passion for employing machine learning and computational mathematics to address tangible problems in areas like medicine and public health.

A significant component of my research involves ensuring ethical standards in AI development. I've integrated fairness algorithms to minimize bias, prioritized transparency in neural network architectures, and actively advocated for the responsible use of AI in public health decisions, most recently when reviewing a body of work by Médecins Sans Frontières. Additionally, during my time at DFKI, I spearheaded initiatives to incorporate AI ethics into our research and engineering protocols, particularly in areas like criminal behavior modelling and societal impact evaluations. This commitment to ethically responsible AI ensures that our solutions not only stand up to rigorous academic scrutiny but also uphold the highest standards of integrity and applicability in real-world scenarios.

My mathematical interests have broadened over time to fields like quantum mechanical modelling. Further, my proficiency in languages, including English, Spanish, German, and French, has been instrumental in facilitating collaborations. Notably, this linguistic capability has enabled meaningful work alongside colleagues from German research institutes such as TU Kaiserslautern and TU Dresden, and extending to collaborations in France with the University of Toulouse.

<!-- When I'm not engrossed in my work, I channel my creativity into the world of 80s retro-synthwave music and the development of 90s-inspired video games. Imagine the charm of Dwarf Fortress and the wonders of the classic Baldur's Gate series. On top of that, I'm penning a fantasy book series, exploring realms and characters of my own design. For a more analog break, if London's weather agrees, I love taking my bike out for a spin. It's my way of connecting with the world outside. -->

# Consulting Services

At Imperial College London, I lead groundbreaking machine learning projects, and as a Research Scientist at the German Centre for Artificial Intelligence, I harnessed the power of intricate algorithms to address a myriad of challenges ranging from malaria modeling and tumor prediction to societal concerns such as the dispersion of gun violence. Notably, within the Imperial COVID-19 real-time modelling group, my innovative models significantly influenced policy decisions at the highest echelons of the British government — a contribution that garnered me the SPI-M-O Award for Modelling and Data Support, on behalf of SAGE from the UK's Chief Scientific and Medical Officers.

My research, often spotlighted in top-tier journals, combines expertise in Bayesian Inferencing, Neural Network emulation, and more to ensure precision in expansive analyses. If you are in search of expertise spanning machine learning, epidemiological analysis, or the broader landscape of computational mathematics, my consulting services stand at the ready. Together, we can strategize, unravel complex problems, and pave the way for research that is impactful, sincere, and resonant.
